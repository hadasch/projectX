Dear Pavel, dear Gary,

Paul Schmidt and myself are preparing for our visit at BRRI in May.  
Our idea for the meeting is to give two presentations:

(1) Hans-Peter Piepho on the statistical approach to genetic gain  
assessment, essentially based on our 2014 paper
(2) Paul Schmidt on the implementation in R / ASREML and examples  
using the BRRI data

We have a couple of questions in relation to our presentation:

(i) How much background on R can we expect among people attending? Are  
people familiar with mixed model packages such as 'nlme' and 'lme4'?
(ii) Some of the things we would like to do can't be done with these  
free R packages but require ASReml-R. Does anyone at BRRI have  
experience with ASReml? How much background can we expect?
(iii) Can you tell us about how many people will be attending?

If you have any suggestions or hints for us to help us prepare that  
would be most welcome.

Best wishes

Hans-Peter
