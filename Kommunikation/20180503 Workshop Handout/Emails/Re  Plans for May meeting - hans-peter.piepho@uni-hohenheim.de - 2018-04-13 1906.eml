Dear all,

we foresee that not all analyses we think should be done can be done  
with free R packages alone. It will be necessary to also use ASReml-R.

We intend to make a compact presentation in which the approach will be  
introduced and our analyses presented. This will be the basis to  
discuss the paper. For those people interested in the details (we  
expect that not everyone will be interested in this), we can also  
prepare a more hands-on step-by-step introduction to show how analyses  
can be implemented in R. If we do this, it would be good if all those  
interested have the R package installed and ready for use on their  
laptops. In addition, it would be good if we could use ASReml-R. VSNi  
have 30-day trial licences. These would need to be ordered from them  
via their webpage.

Can this be arranged from the BRRI side?

Best wishes

Hans-Peter Piepho
