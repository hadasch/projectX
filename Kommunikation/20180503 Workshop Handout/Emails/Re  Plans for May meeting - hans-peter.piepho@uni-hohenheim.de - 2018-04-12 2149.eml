Dear Gary,

yes, we're arriving Saturday (May 5) morning at 8:40 and will depart  
Mondey (7th) evening at 19.30.

We're preparing two talks, one in which I'll detail the approach and  
another in which Paul will explain the analyses done so far. We're  
also preparing to show step by step how these analyses can be done in  
R using open-source mixed model packages.

Best wishes

Hans-Peter
