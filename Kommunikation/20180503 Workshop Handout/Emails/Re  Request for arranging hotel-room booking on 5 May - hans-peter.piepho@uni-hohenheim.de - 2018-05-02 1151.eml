Dear Pavel,

we just noticed that we are to check out on May 6. As our flight back  
to Germany is on May 7, can our booking be extended by one night? Or  
will we be lodged at another place from May 6 to may 7?

Just to be sure: I take it the hotel will pick us up from the airport  
on May 5. Is that correct?

Thank you very much!

Best wishes

Hans-Peter
